## What to work on

Check the [Issues](https://github.com/deotio/claude-stats/issues) tab. Issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/deotio/claude-stats/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are a good starting point.

## Pull request guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Include a clear description of what changed and why
- Reference any related issues (e.g. `Closes #42`)

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:
- Your Node.js version (`node --version`)
- The command you ran
- The error output or unexpected behavior

## Code style

- TypeScript throughout
- No linter is enforced yet, but try to match the existing style
- Prefer small, focused functions
